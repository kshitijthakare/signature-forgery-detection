Digital Image Processing (SWE1010)

Project: Signature Forgery Detection

Details of the folder are as follows -

    signatureforgerydetection.ipynb file contains model
    Forged Images contain dataset for this project in form of real
    Real Images contain dataset for this project in form of real
    "training folder" will save the trained images(this folder will create when you will execute the code)

Some Important points

    Images are stored in the format: XXXZZZ_YYY
    XXX denotes the id of the person who has signed on the document(ex -001)
    ZZZ denotes the id of the person to whom the sign belongs in actual(ex- 001)
    YYY denotes the nth no.of attempt
    Now if XXX == ZZZ then the image is genuine otherwise the signature is forged

Note

    signatureforgerydetection.ipynb file for Jupiter notebook and signatureforgerydetection.py file for code editor
    In the training folder, files are for reference and in the testing folder, files are for testing.
